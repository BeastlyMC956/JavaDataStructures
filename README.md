# Java Data Structures

JavaDataStructures is a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in Java. It includes classes for linked
lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees. The goal of this repository is to provide a set of efficient and
easy-to-use data structures that can be incorporated into a wide range of Java projects and to serve as a reference for
other developers wanting to implement their own data structures.

## Features

* Easy-to-use Java classes for common data structures.
* Efficient implementations that minimize memory usage and maximize performance.
* Comprehensive Javadoc documentation that explains each class and method in detail.
* A simple, intuitive API that makes it easy to use the data structures in your own code.
* A growing collection of unit tests that ensure the correctness and robustness of the code.

## Getting Started

To use the JavaDataStructures library in your own project, simply clone or download the repository and add the relevant
Java files to your project's source directory. You can then import the classes you need and start using the data
structures right away.

For more information on how to use the JavaDataStructures library, please see
